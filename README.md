This proof-of-concept implementation was written at the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Germany,
and in cooperation with Motion Intelligence GmbH, Potsdam, Germany. The project is based on the 'glTF-tiling' approach, 
developed by [A. Schoedon](https://github.com/5chdn/webgl-accessibility-maps-poc5). Utilized technologies are the 
Route360Â°-JS API (https://developers.route360.net/index.html) and the Leaflet-JS library (http://leafletjs.com/).
